# The process to Build Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot.
## 1.	Portable vacuum cleaner
Get a portable vacuum cleaner from amazon. It comes with a very simple mechanism. It has three parts at the bottom (a small storage room for dust, a motor in the center, a fan and a battery socket at the top (there is a cover or cap for the battery), a DC motor and a fan. 1.5-volt AA battery. Disconnect internal battery and power up to 5V. Power supply. So, you have removed all unnecessary parts and only two-wire motor will remain.

## 2.	HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Module
To detect obstructions, we are using the popular HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor or we can call it an obstruction avoidance sensor. The operation is quite simple, first, the transmitter module sends an ultrasonic wave that travels through the air, hits the barrier, and bounces back, and the receiver receives that wave. By calculating the time with Arduino, we can determine the distance.

## 3.	Floor sensor (IR sensor) for staircase detection.
In the features section, we are talking about a feature where a robot can find a ladder and prevent itself from falling. To do that, we are using IR sensors. We will create the interface between the IR sensor and Arduino. The operation of the IR proximity sensor is quite simple, it has an IR LED and a photodiode, the IR LED emits IR light and if there is any obstruction in front of this emitted light it will be reflected, and the reflected light will be recognized. Via photodiode. But the voltage generated by the reflection will be much lower. To amplify it, we can use the op-amp comparator, we can amplify and get the output. The IR module consists of three pins Vcc, ground, and output. Usually, the output decreases when the sensor is interrupted. So, we can use this to find the floor. If for a split second, we find a height above the sensor, we can stop the robot, turn it back, or do anything to prevent it from falling down the stairs.

We have three ultrasonic sensors that detect obstructions. Therefore, it is necessary to connect all the ground of your ultrasonic sensors and connect them to the common ground. Also, we connect all three Vccâ€™s of the sensor and connect them to the common VCC pin. Next, we will connect the trigger and echo pin to Arduino's PWM pin. We connect the VR 5V of the IR module to the ground pin of the Arduino, the output pin of the IR sensor module goes to the digital pin D2 of the Arduino. For the motor driver, we connect two capable pins 5v, and the driver voltage pin 5v because we are using a 5-volt motor. In the previous article, we created the Arduino motor driver shield, you can check it out to learn more about the L293D motor driver IC and its operations. Arduino, ultrasonic modules, motor drivers, and motors operate at 5 volts, the high voltage will destroy it and we are using the 7.4-volt battery, to convert it to 5 volts, LM7805 voltage regulator is used. Connect the vacuum cleaner directly to the main circuit.

## 4.	Creating a circuit for a smart vacuum cleaner robot
To solder each component together, first, we take a small piece of dotted perfboard, place each component according to the circuit diagram, and solder everything. This part is very simple. After perfboard soldering is complete, we attach the wire to the ultrasonic modules and attach them to the corresponding pins.

## 5.	Build a house for a smart vacuum cleaner robot
To get some ideas about robots, we searched online for vacuum cleaner robots and found some images of round-shaped robots and as we liked them, we decided to create a round-shaped robot. We have a lot of options like foam sheets, MDF, cardboard, etc. to chase the robot and make the main part. But we choose MDF here because it is tough and has some water-resistant properties.

To build the robot, we took an MDF sheet, then drew two circles with a radius of 8 cm and also another circle with a radius of 4 cm to fit the vacuum cleaner in that circle. Then we cut circles. Also, we have to cut the right pieces for the wheel path. Finally, we have to make three small holes for the castor wheel. The next step is to attach the motors to the base using its brackets, keep the castor wheel in its position and fix it. Next, place the ultrasonic sensor on the left, right, and center of the robot. Also, connect the IR module to the downside of the robot. Add external switch on.

For the top, we also need to draw a circle of 11 cm radius on the foam sheet and cut it. To keep the distance between the top and the bottom, you have to make three 4 cm long pieces of a plastic tube. Next, we glue the plastic spacer to the bottom and then to the top.

For the top, we have also drawn a circle of 11 cm radius on the foam sheet and cut it. To keep the distance between the top and the bottom, you cut three 4 cm long pieces of a plastic tube. After that, we glued the plastic spacer on the bottom and then we glued the top.

Then Enjoy with Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot !!!
